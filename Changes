version 0.003; 2010-01-11

  * fully support bareword subroutine references on Perl 5.11.2 and later

  * in XS, avoid using "class" as a variable name, for compatibility
    with C++ compilers

  * correct data type for the PAD_MAX constant

  * in Build.PL, explicitly declare configure-time requirements

version 0.002; 2009-10-26

  * port to Perl 5.11.0, supporting the addition of first-class regexp
    objects (which are actually a type of scalar) and the removal of
    the distinct RV type

  * where the compilation %^H and PL_compcv are unavailable due to string
    eval or similar, detect this earlier and regardless of the type of
    item being set up (previously it was not detected for subroutines
    or globs)

  * when a lexical scalar has readonly value, generate a const op instead
    of the usual rv2sv

  * document the problem of %^H and PL_compcv being unavailable due to
    string eval

  * preserve op flags when building new rv2Xv ops; this doesn't seem to
    matter in any currently achievable situation, but will be required
    for bareword subroutine references in the future

  * in XS, properly parenthesise some macro definitions

  * test writability of lexical variables

  * in t/error.t, check for unexpected warnings

  * add experimental code, all disabled, to support bareword subroutine
    references on a suitably modified Perl core

version 0.001; 2009-09-30

  * bugfix: make array and hash indexing work

  * bugfix: avoid core checks that would reject use of a glob as a
    scalar value

  * bugfix: avoid modifying the reference stored in the hint hash (which
    happened through reusing it in const ops)

  * bugfix: repair a reference leak in unimportation

  * bugfix: change a memNE() to strnNE(), to avoid reading off the end
    of a string

  * bugfix: require bugfixed version of Lexical::SealRequireHints (for
    fixes around usability of its pure-Perl implementation)

  * port to pre-5.10 Perls

  * more tests: Lexical::Sub, array and hash variables, glob variables,
    acceptability of value types for references to lexical variables,
    erroneous invocation of import and unimport

  * in XS, add some casts to avoid compiler warnings

  * check for required Perl version at runtime

version 0.000; 2009-09-23

  * initial released version
