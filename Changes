version 0.001; 2009-09-30

  * bugfix: make array and hash indexing work

  * bugfix: avoid core checks that would reject use of a glob as a
    scalar value

  * bugfix: avoid modifying the reference stored in the hint hash (which
    happened through reusing it in const ops)

  * bugfix: repair a reference leak in unimportation

  * bugfix: change a memNE() to strnNE(), to avoid reading off the end
    of a string

  * bugfix: require bugfixed version of Lexical::SealRequireHints (for
    fixes around usability of its pure-Perl implementation)

  * port to pre-5.10 Perls

  * more tests: Lexical::Sub, array and hash variables, glob variables,
    acceptability of value types for references to lexical variables,
    erroneous invocation of import and unimport

  * in XS, add some casts to avoid compiler warnings

  * check for required Perl version at runtime
